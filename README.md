# Covid Cases Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Goal

The goal of this project is to solve a regression problem using deep neural networks. Basic DNN training techniques will be implemented (hyper parameter tuning, feature selection, regularization, etc.). The objective is to get more familiar with PyTorch and DNN architecture.

## Task Description

Given survey results in the past 3 days in a specific state in U.S., then predict the percentage of new tested positive cases in the 3rd day.
